    "paragraph2": "Pandu officers are highly valued professionals because they play a key role, are rare, have special skills, and are in high demand. Currently, there are approximately 1,200 members spread across the archipelago, from Sabang to Merauke, from Miangas to Rote, with the following main duties:",
    "paragraph3": "In carrying out their noble duties, Maritime Scout Officers are bound by the following laws and conventions:",
